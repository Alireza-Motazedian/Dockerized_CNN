## 1. Overview

This directory contains visualizations generated for the CNN MNIST project. These visualizations help understand the dataset, model training process, model performance, and the internal representations learned by the CNN.

The directory contains both visualizations from the original CNN implementation and a simpler CNN architecture for comparison. Note that some files may be generated when you run the corresponding scripts or notebooks.

## 3. Visualization Descriptions

### 3.1 MNIST Samples (mnist_samples.png)
A grid visualization of sample digits from the MNIST dataset. Each row represents a different digit class (0-9), and each column shows different examples of handwritten digits. This visualization helps understand the variability within each digit class.

### 3.2 Confusion Matrix (confusion_matrix.png & simple_cnn_confusion_matrix.png)
A heatmap showing the model's performance across all digit classes. The rows represent the true digit labels, and the columns represent the predicted labels. The diagonal elements represent correct predictions, while off-diagonal elements represent misclassifications. The simple CNN confusion matrix shows results from a basic CNN architecture.

### 3.3 Training History (training_history.png & simple_cnn_training_history.png)
Line plots showing the evolution of training and validation metrics (accuracy and loss) over training epochs. This helps visualize the learning progress and identify potential overfitting or underfitting. The simple CNN training history shows the learning progression of our basic CNN implementation.

### 3.4 Feature Maps (feature_maps.png & feature_maps/test_samples.png)
Visualizations of the CNN's internal representations (activations) for sample input images. These visualizations show what features different convolutional layers are detecting, from simple edges in early layers to more complex patterns in deeper layers. The test_samples.png shows feature maps for specific test examples.

### 3.5 Prediction Samples (prediction_samples.png & simple_cnn_misclassified.png)
A grid of example predictions from the model, including both correct and incorrect classifications. For each example, the true label and predicted label are shown, helping to understand the types of digits the model struggles with. The simple_cnn_misclassified.png specifically focuses on digits that were incorrectly classified by the simple CNN model.

## 4. Generating Visualizations

These visualizations are generated by various scripts and notebooks in the project:

1. **MNIST Samples**: Generated by `scripts/extract_sample_images.py` or from the notebooks
2. **Confusion Matrix**: Created during model evaluation in `scripts/train_cnn.py` or the training notebook
3. **Training History**: Produced at the end of model training in `scripts/train_cnn.py`
4. **Feature Maps**: Generated by `scripts/visualize_features.py`
5. **Prediction Samples**: Created during model evaluation in notebooks or scripts

To regenerate these visualizations, you can run the corresponding scripts or notebooks. For example:

```bash
# Generate MNIST sample grid
python scripts/extract_sample_images.py

# Generate feature map visualizations
python scripts/visualize_features.py
```

Alternatively, you can execute the visualization code in the Jupyter notebooks.
